Q1: Longest Consecutive Sequence
Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the longest sequence of consecutive
numbers in the array.



Q3: Debugging Fibonacci Function
The following Python function is supposed to return the n-th Fibonacci number, but it contains
an error.
Task:
● Identify the issue in the function.
● Fix the function so that it correctly calculates Fibonacci numbers.

def fibonacci(n):
if n == 0:
return 0
elif n == 1:
return 1
else:
return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

Steps to Follow:
1. Identify the bug in the function.
2. Fix the function to compute Fibonacci numbers correctly.
3. Ensure the function runs efficiently for larger values of n.
